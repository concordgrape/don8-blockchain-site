# Don8: Blockchain


## General info
This is a simple blockchain based off of Naivechain [(Github)](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain)
However, it allows for a difficulty value as well as a nonce value. This stops past blocks from being edited


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Typescript 2.4.1


## Setup
These are quick instructions to start the blockchain

```
$ cd /Blockchain          -> Change your directory to the blockchain server
$ npm start               -> Start the blockchain server
